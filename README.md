## Description
This app converts your data ‒ copy-pasted from Excel, a CSV or other text-based formats ‒ into an html table.

You can also see some statistics about your data like number of rows, columns and empty cells.

## Known issues
### No support for line breaks
It's not supported to paste tables from _Microsoft Office Excel_ that include line breaks.

*Why?* ‒ There's technically no difference between line breaks and a new table row. There's no way to tell them apart.
